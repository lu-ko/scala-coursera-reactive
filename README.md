## Welcome to Principles of Reactive Programming

Over the next seven weeks you will learn the fundamentals of this new programming paradigm by watching weekly lectures, doing inline quizzes and home assignments. 

 You find lectures and assignments for the first week on the course page. There are also some videos that help you get started with setting up the tools you'll need for solving the assignments.

 If you have questions or remarks, please participate in the forums. We will be watching forum threads and explain where necessary. But the added value of the forums really comes from having discussions between students. 

 We hope you'll find the class interesting.
